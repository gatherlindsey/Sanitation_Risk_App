"#Sanitation_Risk_App" 

The code to create a Shiny App using R. 

It will run an application showing the three sanitation risk indexes (SRI) created by Gatherhub. 
Each SRI is represented in a different map, each with a description of the formula for how it was created. 

The work was funded by the World Bank. 

Run the UI.r or Server.r files.
